The major\r\npieces are:\r\n\r\n. libmdb    - the core library that allows access to MDB files programatically.\r\n. libmdbsql - builds on libmdb to provide a SQL engine (aka Jet)\r\n. utils     - provides command line utilities:\r\n              mdb-ver    -- prints the version (JET 3 or 4) of an mdb file.\r\n              mdb-schema -- prints DDL for the specified table.\r\n              mdb-export -- export table to CSV format.\r\n              mdb-tables -- a simple dump of table names to be used with shell\r\n                            scripts\r\n              mdb-header -- generates a C header to be used in exporting mdb\r\n                            data to a C prog.\r\n              mdb-parsecsv -- generates a C program given a CSV file made with\r\n                            mdb-export\r\n              mdb-sql    -- if --enable-sql is specified, a simple SQL engine\r\n                            (also used by ODBC and gmdb).\r\n            - And some utilities useful for debugging:\r\n              prcat      -- prints the catalog table from an mdb file.\r\n              prkkd      -- dump of information about design view data given the offset to it.\r\n              prtable    -- dump of a table definition.\r\n              prdata     -- dump of the data given a table name.\r\n              prole      -- dump of ole columns given a table name and sargs.\r\n. mdb-sql   - a command line SQL tool that allows one to type sql queries and\r\n              get results.\r\n. odbc      - An ODBC driver for use with unixODBC or iODBC driver manager.\r\n              Allows one to use MDB files with PHP for example.\r\n. gmdb2     - The Gnome MDB File Viewer and debugger.  Still alpha, but making\r\n              great progress.\r\n. extras    - extra command line utilities\r\n              mdb-dump   -- simple hex dump utility that I've been using to look\r\n                            at mdb files.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in helping, read the HACKING file for a description of \r\nwhere the code stands and what has been gleened of the file format.\r\n\r\nThe initial goal of these tools is to be able to extract data structures and \r\ndata from mdb files.  This goal will of course expand over time as the file \r\nformat becomes more well understood.\r\n\r\nFiles in libmdb, libmdbsql, and libmdbodbc are licensed under LGPL and the\r\nutilities and gui program are under the GPL, see COPYING.LIB and COPYING files\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n=============\r\n\r\nFirst, you must have reasonably current installations of:\r\n\tlibtool\r\n\tautomake\r\n\tautoconf (version >= 2.58)\r\nIf you don't you should install them first. Sources are available at\r\nftp.gnu.org.\r\n\r\nSecond, you need glib. It may come as glib2.0 and glib2.0-dev packages in your\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nIf you want to build the SQL engine, you'll need bison or byacc, and flex.\r\n\r\nIf you want to build the ODBC driver, you'll need unixodbc (version 2.2.10 or\r\nabove) or iodbc.\r\n\r\nIf you want to build man pages, you'll need txt2man. Source is available at\r\nhttp://mvertes.free.fr/download/.\r\n\r\nIf you want to generate the html version of the docbook, you'll need openjade\r\nand basic dsl catalogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation from source:\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nLast version is available at https://github.com/brianb/mdbtools\r\n\r\n  $ autoreconf -i -f\r\n\r\nIf you want to build the html version of the docbook documentation, you need to\r\nset the environment variable DOCBOOK_DSL to the modular dsl translation file.\r\nFor exemple, before configure, you need something like:\r\n\r\n  $ export DOCBOOK_DSL=/usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/dsssl/modular/html/docbook.dsl\r\n\r\n  $ ./configure\r\n\r\nOR for a complete install (requires bison, flex, and unixODBC):\r\n\r\n  $ ./configure --with-unixodbc=/usr/local\r\n\r\nconfigure can be passed any of the following flags to turn on other \r\ncapabilities.  Note that the options --with-unixodbc and --with-iodbc are\r\nmutually exclusive.\r\n--with-unixodbc  specifies the location of the unixODBC driver manager and \r\n                 causes the unixODBC driver to be built.\r\n--with-iodbc     specifies the location of the iODBC driver manager and \r\n                 causes the iODBC driver to be built.\r\nA list of general options is available in the INSTALL file, and\r\n\"configure --help\" will give you the list of mdbtools specific options.\r\n\r\n  $ make\r\n\r\nOnce MDB Tools has been compiled, libmdb.[so|a] will be in the src/libmdb \r\ndirectory and the utility programs will be in the src/util directory.\r\n\r\nYou can then run 'make install' as root to install (to /usr/local by default).\r\nSome systems will also need the ld cache to be updated after installation;\r\nYou can do that running 'ldconfig' as root.\r\n\r\n\r\nContacts\r\n========\r\n\r\nThe mailing list from the old site is available at\r\nhttp://mdbtools.sourceforge.net\r\n\r\nPlease send bug repports to the new github platform.\r\nhttps://github.com/brianb/mdbtools/issues\r\n\r\n\r\nBrian Bruns\r\nbrian@bruns.com\r\n\r\nP.S. I, like many other free software authors, enjoy receiving postcards from the\r\nplaces users of my software live.  So, if you enjoy the software and it has \r\nhelped you out, consider sending me one, eh?  Just email me for my postal address.\r\n",
